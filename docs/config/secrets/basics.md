# App Secrets

The Secrets class is autogenerated from a `secrets.json` file. This must be a simple Dictionary of keys and values.

```json
{
  "ClientId": "{client id}",
  "ClientSecret": "{client secret}"
}
```

!!! danger "Critical Note"
    Be sure to add the secrets.json to your .gitignore. If this is accidently checked into source control it negates the entire purpose of use the Secrets from the Mobile.BuildTools!
